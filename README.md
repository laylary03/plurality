# plurality.c

This is my implementation of the **Plurality voting system** from Harvardâ€™s [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x) course.

## ðŸ—³ Problem Summary

In a plurality election, the candidate with the most votes wins. This program:

- Accepts candidate names as command-line arguments
- Prompts for the number of voters and each vote
- Tallies votes based on string comparisons
- Prints the winner(s) of the election

## ðŸ’¡ Personal Note

I approached this challenge in my own way â€” even implementing **selection sort** to help identify the winner(s). It wasnâ€™t the most conventional route, but it worked, and Iâ€™m proud of that.

This problem challenged me to think beyond the spec and apply sorting logic to solve real-world vote counting. No shortcuts â€” just problem-solving.

## ðŸ›  Concepts Practiced

- Structs
- Arrays of structs
- String comparison
- Vote tallying
- Sorting algorithms (custom logic)

## âœ… Status

Passed all `check50` tests for Plurality.
